# Heterogeneous-ensemble.
A heterogeneous ensemble is a predictive model that enhances the accuracy and resilience of predictions by combining multiple models with distinct algorithms or architectures. To employ this method on the insurance dataset, the following steps can be taken:

Load the insurance dataset and import the required libraries.
Partition the data into training and testing sets.
Create multiple models using various algorithms such as decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machines, and gradient boosting.
Train each model on the training set by adjusting their parameters to minimize the training error.
Use each model to predict the target variable on the testing set.
Merge the predictions of each model by using a weighted or unweighted average, reflecting their performance on the validation set.
Evaluate the performance of the ensemble model on a distinct test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Optimize the parameters of each model and ensemble to achieve better performance.
To implement this in code, we first load the insurance dataset and divide it into features (X) and target (y). Then, we divide the data into training and testing sets. Next, we use a column transformer to preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding and scaling numerical variables using standardization. We define three different base models, including a decision tree regressor, a support vector machine regressor, and a multi-layer perceptron regressor. We combine these three models using a voting regressor to create a heterogeneous ensemble. We create a pipeline that employs the column
